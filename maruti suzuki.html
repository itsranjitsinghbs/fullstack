            Maruti Suzuki India Limited is the leading car manufacturer in India. Its earlier name was Maruti Udyog Limited. This company is a subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corporation, the Japanese car and bike manufacturing giant. Having its headquarters in New Delhi, Maruti Suzuki India Limited manufactures popular passenger cars, such as Alto, Baleno, Swift Dzire, S-Cross, Ertiga, Ciaz, WagonR and so on.
            Maruti started production of cars in 1983 with the Maruti 800 being the first model. This model revolutionised the Indian automobile industry as an affordable, small and compact family car. It was sort of a status symbol at that time to own a Maruti 800.
